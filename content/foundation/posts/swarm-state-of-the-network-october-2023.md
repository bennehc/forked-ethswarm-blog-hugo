### Data Considerations

All data in this report is based on nodes which have won the redistribution game at least once per month. While on average the number of win events per month for running a single node is greater than one, it is possible to operate a single node for a month without a win event occurring.

### Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric is the total monthly rewards paid out across the entire network.

| Month      | Total Rewards (BZZ) |
|------------|---------------------|
| May        | 21423               |
| June       | 26655               |
| July       | 34839               |
| August     | 135927              |
| September  | 147825              |
| **October**| **152868**          |

![chart-Total-Network-Monthly-Rewards.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk9Q5Lv76.png)


In October, the Swarm network's total monthly rewards reached a new high of **152,868 BZZ**, continuing the upward trend observed in previous months and indicating robust network activity and reward distribution.

### Single Node Monthly Average Earnings

This metric is the average total winnings per staking node per month.

| Month      | Average Earnings (BZZ) |
|------------|------------------------|
| May        | 14.85                  |
| June       | 18.84                  |
| July       | 22.61                  |
| August     | 68.20                  |
| September  | 69.56                  |
| **October**| **48.36**              |

![chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkNQcUDmp.png)

October's average earnings per node saw a decrease to **48.36 BZZ** from September's 69.56 BZZ. This change suggests a redistribution of rewards, possibly due to an increase in the number of participating nodes.

### Monthly Median Win Values

This metric is the median win amount for each win event.

| Month      | Median Win Value (BZZ) |
|------------|------------------------|
| May        | 6.40                   |
| June       | 8.29                   |
| July       | 9.63                   |
| August     | 43.97                  |
| September  | 44.62                  |
| **October**| **46.84**              |

![chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1qGcIvXT.png)


The median win value for October slightly increased to **46.84 BZZ**, maintaining the general upward trend and indicating that the median node's earnings remain robust.

### Monthly Average Win Values

This metric is the average win amount for each win event.

| Month      | Average Win Value (BZZ) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| May        | 8.29                    |
| June       | 10.14                   |
| July       | 12.07                   |
| August     | 41.45                   |
| September  | 46.52                   |
| **October**| **62.09**               |

![chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByNM9LDXp.png)



The average win value in October significantly increased to **62.09 BZZ**, suggesting that while the average earnings per node decreased, the wins that did occur were for larger amounts.

### Number of Staking Nodes by Month

This is determined by the number of unique staking nodes each month which have won at least once in that month (as noted above, it does not include nodes which did not win in that month).

| Month      | Number of Nodes |
|------------|-----------------|
| May        | 1443            |
| June       | 1415            |
| July       | 1541            |
| August     | 1993            |
| September  | 2125            |
| **October**| **2462**        |

![chart-Number-of-Staking-Nodes-by-Month.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B16WqUwm6.png)



The number of unique staking nodes in October rose to **2,462**, marking a continued increase and highlighting the growing interest and participation in the Swarm network.

### Total Active Nodes by Month

This metric is defined as the total number of unique nodes (both staking and non-staking nodes) which are active on the Swarm network each month.

| Month      | Number of Nodes |
|------------|-----------------|
| May        | 4352            |
| June       | 4002            |

| September  | 5107            |
| **October**| **5138**        |

![chart-Total-Active-Nodes-by-Month.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkI-98PXa.png)


The total number of active nodes in October showed a slight increase to **5,138**, indicating a stable growth in the network's size and activity.

### Staking Nodes by Country (Top 6)

This metric shows the number of unique staking nodes per month in the top five countries, with unknown countries and those with fewer nodes included in the "Others" category.

| Month      | China | Finland | Germany | Belgium | France | Others |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| May        | 489   | 412     | 266     | 74      | 24     | 178    |

| **October**| **899**| **636** | **804** | **0**   | **1**  | **122**|

![Total Staking Nodes by Country](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByyAuIvXp.png)

In October, there was a notable resurgence of staking nodes in China, increasing to **899**. Germany saw a decrease to **804**, while Finland also experienced a reduction in its staking nodes. The "Others" category saw a slight increase, indicating a diversification in the network's global distribution.

### Conclusion

October's data for the Swarm network underscores a dynamic and evolving ecosystem. The increase in total rewards and the number of active nodes reflects a healthy and growing network. Despite a decrease in average earnings per node, the rise in median and average win values suggests that the network is becoming more competitive. The geographical distribution of nodes continues to shift, reflecting the global and decentralized nature of the Swarm network. The overall trend remains positive, with October building on the growth and patterns established in previous
