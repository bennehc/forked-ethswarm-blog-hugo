# Swarm communication has moved to Discord

For the last few weeks, the Swarm community has been growing rapidly. Hordes of people have come to join the network in its early stages.

This is why it’s time to rethink and organize the tech support in a more structured way. To do so, we decided to join all official Swarm communication channels in Discord and to slowly abandon the old ones.

There will be separate channels for tech support, token sale, airdrop, and other Swarm-related topics. We are working hard on ensuring tech support in several different languages. Chinese and Russian tech support is already available on Discord.

We invite you to join our discussions and become an active member of our wonderful community.
