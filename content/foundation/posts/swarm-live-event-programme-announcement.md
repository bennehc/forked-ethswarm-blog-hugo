24 November 2020 is just around the corner and with it the fancy, new Swarm Live release. Increased performance, more stability, and nicely polished features are just a few of the qualities that prove that things are going in the right direction. Swarm Live is **the last official release before the final product release. It has all the high-level features in place.**

All this and more will be discussed and presented by the team at the **Swarm Live (online) event,** happening the same day — **24 November 2020 at 14:00 CET**. [Please make sure you RSVP to register for the event.](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/live.swarm.eth/)

**What to expect at the event?**

This time it will be short & sweet. Two and a half hours packed with useful information, interesting speakers, demos, ecosystem updates, and announcements. The team will present what Swarm Live is and what can be done with it.

**The Programme:**

* The event starts with an awesome special guest, who will be kept secret until the event.
* Rinke will explain Swarm incentives in detail and make a very interesting announcement.
* Janos will describe what’s new in the Swarm Live release and present Swarm’s vision for the ecosystem integration.
* Eduardo Antuña Díez (DAppNode Project Lead) will demonstrate the simplicity of installing a Bee node with DAppNode.
* Attila will present the newly established Swarm JS team and talk about their goals and progress.
* You will witness a PSS Zero-Leak messaging demo by Dan.
