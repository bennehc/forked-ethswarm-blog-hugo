description = "In January, the Bee Track released a new version of the Bee client (1.11) that brings an important update to uploads with mutable batches. This update causes newer chunks in a batch to replace older ones on the network. The Research Track, on the other hand, is nearing completion of Phase 3 of the storage incentives and is making great progress in producing documentation for Phases 4 and 5."
